I was thinking about the introduction to the section and was thinking about something along the lines of, "In the past few sections we've dealt with arrays that let us manage collections of data in memory. However we usually don't want to write a program that only deals with one particular set of data that we create in the program itself. We'd like to write a program that can process different data at different times. **Files** are how computers store data that programs can access. When we write a program that gets its data from files rather than from arrays that are hard coded into the program our programs can be more flexible. Files are also useful when the total amount of data we need to process is bigger than can fit into our computer's memory."
