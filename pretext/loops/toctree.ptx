  <title>Loops</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      As we discussed in <xref ref="topic-2-1-algorithms" />, at the beginning
      of the previous unit, the basic building blocks of algorithms are
      sequencing, selection, and repetition. The rest of <xref
      ref="booleans-and-conditionals" /> covered Java’s main selection
      construct, the <c>if</c> statement. In this unit we turn to Java’s
      repetition, or looping, constructs.
    </p>

    <p>
      First we will look at the control constructs themselves, <c>while</c> and
      <c>for</c> loops. Then at how we can use them, in combination with
      <c>if</c> statements, to implement some simple but important complete
      algorithms.
