      BHSawesome2 is a AP CSA textbook adapted from CSAwesome2 for use at
      Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California. It follow the latest (2025)
      revision of the AP Computer Science A Course and Exam Description but
      presents the material in a somewhat different order than CSAwesome2 and
      does not attempt to mirror the unit and topic structure of the College
      Board Course and Exam Description. If you want a text whose units and
      topic numbers line up exactly with those in the College Board outline, you
      will want to use CSAwesome2.
