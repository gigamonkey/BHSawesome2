  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this introductory chapter, we will take a quick look at what
      programming and Java are all about and then write our first simple Java
      program and run it right within this book. (If you haven't yet, you should
      probably watch the video explaining the interactive features of this book
      in the <xref ref="frontmatter" text="title" />.)

    <p>
      After that there are a few notes about the AP course and exam, some things
      to think about if you happen to be coming to this course after taking the
      other AP computer science course, AP CSP, and some general things to keep
      in mind as you work your way through the sometimes daunting task of
      learning a new langauge.
