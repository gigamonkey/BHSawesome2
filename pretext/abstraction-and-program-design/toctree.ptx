  <title>program design</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      By now we have covered almost all the mechanics of writing Java programs
      from primitive types and basic control constructs to using classes—our
      own, classes built into Java such as <c>ArrayList</c>, <c>Scanner</c>, and
      <c>Files</c>, and classes written by other programmers like <c>Turtle</c>
      and <c>World</c>. And we have looked at some of the important kinds of
      algorithms that come up in many programs: searching, sorting, and
      recursion.

    <p>
      In some sense that’s all we need to know to write Java programs. Now it’s
      just a matter of putting the pieces together. However, as you’ve probably
      already discovered even small programs can start to get complicated and it
      can be hard to keep track of all the pieces and how they fit together.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this unit, we will look at how to think at a higher level about
      designing our programs. For any given program that we might want to write
      there are many, many ways to break it down into classes. While the Java
      compiler doesn’t care how your program is organized, as long as it follows
      the rules of Java, programmers have learned that it matters a lot us
      humans.

    <p>
      In this chapter we will look at some of the ways to think about our
      classes and how they fit together that we can use before we jump into
      coding. In particular we will look some key kinds of
      <term>abstraction</term> and how they help us keep our programs
      manageable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the last section we’ll look at some of the larger implications of
      designing programs: how software affects society and some issues we need
      to think about when designing software to avoid harms it might cause.
