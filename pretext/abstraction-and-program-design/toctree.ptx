  <title>Program design</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the last two chapters we learned the mechanics of how to write our own
      <term>classes</term> and to use <term>objects</term> defined by those
      classes, by classes built-in to Java, and by classes written by other
      programmers such as the <c>Turtle</c> class. In this unit, we will look at
      how to think at a higher level about designing our programs. For any given
      program that we might want to write there are many, many ways to break it
      down into classes. While the Java compiler doesn’t care how your program
      is organized, as long as it follows the rules of Java, programmers have
      learned that it matters a lot to human programmers.

    <p>
      In this chapter we will look at some of the ways to think about our
      classes and how they fit together that we can use before we jump into
      coding. In particular we will look some key kinds of
      <term>abstraction</term> and how they help us keep our programs
      manageable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the last section we’ll look at some of the larger implications of
      designing programs: how software affects society and some issues we need
      to think about when designing software to avoid harms it might cause.
