    <p>
      In <xref ref="primitive-types-and-variables" /> we discussed the the
      lowest level elements of Java: values, variables, and expressions. And in
      the <xref ref="introduction" /> we wrote bits of code inside a <c>main</c>
      method without looking too deeply into how that works.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter we're going to look more closely at <term>methods</term>,
      which are Java's way of creating <term>procedural abstractions</term>.
      Methods are named chunks of code that we can <term>call</term> in order to
      run the code. In other languages they are called lots of things such as
      functions, procedures, or subroutines. And in block programming languages
      like Snap! they are called blocks.
    </p>

    <p>
      But whatever they are called, procedural abstractions, like all
      abstractions, hide certain details. Like variables abstract away the
      details of particular values by letting us refer to a value with a
      meaningful name, methods abstract away the details of how a computation is
      performed by letting us refer to the computation with the name of the
      method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Writing methods lets us break a large program into problem down into
      smaller more manageable chunks. Additionally, we can also use methods
      written by other programmers without having to worry about the details of
      exactly how they work. We just need to know the method’s name and what
      arguments it expects. Later in this unit we’ll look at several methods
      from the class <c>Math</c> that comes with Java, which save us from having
      to know, for instance, how to compute square roots.
