    BHSawesome is derived from the excellent CSAwesome, a free AP CSA curriculum
    that is endorsed by the College Board as an official AP CSA curriculum and
    PD provider for the 2025-2026 AP CSA revision. BHSawesome was created by
    Peter Seibel, computer science teacher at Berkeley High School and a
    contributor to CSAwesome.

    The primary difference between BHSawesome and CSAwesome is the latter is
    designed to closely follow the ordering of material laid out by the College
    Board's Course and Exam Description. BHSawesome was reorganized to take a
    different path through the material.

    Credit to my friend Sarah Milstein for suggesting the update to my “people
    on line to by movie tickets” metaphor to “people on line to get a cinnamon
    bun or slice of pizza that's gone viral on TikTok”.
