    BHSawesome is derived from the excellent CSAwesome, a free AP CSA curriculum
    that is endorsed by the College Board as an official AP CSA curriculum and
    PD provider for the 2025-2026 AP CSA revision. It was revised by Peter
    Seibel, computer science teacher at Berkeley High School and a contributor
    to CSAwesome.

    The primary difference between BHSawesome and CSAwesome is the latter is
    designed to closely follow the ordering of material laid out by the College
    Board's Course and Exam Description. BHSawesome was reorganized to take a
    different path through the material.
