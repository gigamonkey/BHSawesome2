  <title>About the AP CSA exam</title>

  <p>
    This curriculum will prepare you for the Advanced Placement Computer Science
    A Exam which tests your programming skills in Java.
  </p>

  <p>
    The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections: multiple choice and
    free-response. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
    first part has 42 multiple-choice questions worth 55% of your grade, and the
    second part has 4 free response questions (FRQs), where you write Java code,
    worth 45% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the <url
    href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference.pdf">AP
    CSA Java Quick Reference Sheet</url>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The 4 free response questions are shorter than previous years and cover the
    following areas to total 25 points (from <url

    CSA Free Response</url>):

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Free Response Question 1 Methods and Control Structures (7
          points)</term>: Students will write two methods or one constructor and
          one method of a given class based on provided specifications and
          examples. In Part A (4 points), the method or constructor will require
          students to write iterative or conditional statements, or both, as
          well as statements that call methods in the specified class. In Part B
          (3 points), the method or constructor will require calling
          <term>String</term> methods.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Free Response Question 2 Class Design (7 points)</term>:
          Students will be instructed to design and implement a class based on
          provided specifications and examples. A second class might also be
          included. Students will be provided with a scenario and specifications
          in the form of a table demonstrating ways to interact with the class
          and the results. The class must include a class header, instance
          variables, a constructor, a method, and implementation of the
          constructor and required methods.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Free Response Question 3 Data Analysis with ArrayList (5
          points)</term>: Students will be provided with a scenario and its
          associated class(es). Students will write one method of a given class
          based on provided specifications and examples. The method requires
          students to use, analyze,and manipulate data in an
          <term>ArrayList</term> structure.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <term>Free Response Question 4 2D Array (6 points)</term>: Students
          will be provided with a scenario and its associated class(es).
          Students will write one method of a given class based on provided
          specifications and examples. The method requires students to use,
          analyze,and manipulate data in a <term>2D array</term> structure.
          (This usually requires the use of nested loops.)
        </p>

    </ul>

  <p>
    As of the 2025-26 school year, the College Board specifies the AP CSA course
    in the 4 units shown in the table below. On the College Board’s AP Portal
    they provide formative assessments called Personal Progress Checks for each
    unit. BHSawesome does not follow exactly the unit structure in the order
    laid out by the College Board but covers all the same material.
  </p>

  <p>
    The College Board also requires AP CSA courses to provide at least 20 hours
    of lab time for you to practice Java programming.
