      Welcome to BHSawesome an interactive AP CSA textbook. As you work your way
      through this book you will encounter a number of interactive activities
      that will ask you answer questions, rearrange blocks of code into correct
      sequences, and write your own Java code which will be compiled and run for
      you.

      The following <url
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn9_HaX3m7s">video</url> introduces
      some of the features of this book. Note however, the video is made for
      CSAwesome, another textbook from which this book was adapted. Thus the
      units mentioned in the video are not exactly the same as in this book but
      the exercises are the same.
