  <title>Objects</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Programs usually consist of many classes that are combined in various
      ways. One class can have instance variables whose types are other classes
      meaning that objects of one class can hold references to objects of other
      classes. We can make arrays of object references. And object references
      can be passed as arguments to methods and returned from methods.

    <p>
      This ability to make complex structures out of relatively simple objects
      is one of the most powerful feature of object-oriented programming as it
      lets us manage the complexity of those structures by breaking them into
      comprehensible pieces.
