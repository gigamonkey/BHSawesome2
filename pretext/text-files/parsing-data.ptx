  <introduction>
    <p>
      While methods like <c>Scanner.nextLine</c> or <c>Files.readAllLines</c>
      allow us to get the contents of a file broken up into lines, if we want to
      do computations with that data we will often need to convert the data into
      other types like <c>int</c> or <c>double</c> to work with. The process of
      extracting structure from a linear sequence of characters in a
      <c>String</c> is called <term>parsing</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section we’ll look at some relatively simple kinds of parsing,
      turning the lines in a CSV file like <c>pokemon.csv</c> from the previous
      section into data we can work with.
    </p>

  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="split">
    <title>Splitting strings</title>

    <idx>split</idx>
    <p>
      If you take a look at the Pokemon CSV file, you’ll notice that each line
      contains multiple values by commas. These values are the attributes of a
      single Pokemon: its name, type, speed, etc. Often the first line of a CSV
      file is a header line, indicating the names of these attributes.
    </p>

    <program language="text">
      Number,Pokemon,Type 1,Type 2,HP,Attack,Defense,Speed,PNG,Description
    </program>

    <p>
      So our first task, if we want to do something more interesting with the
      Pokemon data than just counting how many lines are in the file is to parse
      each line into the individual values.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <c>String</c> class provides a useful method <c>split(String
      delimeter)</c> that splits a string into an array of substrings based on a
      specified <term>delimiter</term> which is a character like a comma or a
      space that separates the units of data. This method returns a
      <c>String</c> array where each element in the array contains one substring
      from the original string.
    </p>

    <program>
      String sentence = "A quick brown fox jumps";
      // Split the sentence into words along spaces to create:
      //  words = {"A", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps"}
      String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
    </program>

    <p>
      Here is an example of how to use the split method to split a line of data
      with commas separating the fields from the Pokemon csv file into
      identifiable chunks of data. The first line of headers in the file
      indicates that the 0th element of the data array is the Pokemon’s number,
      element 1 is the name, etc. We only need to save the data that we want to
      use. In this case, we want to save the <c>name</c>, <c>type1</c>,
      <c>speed</c>, and <c>imageFile</c>. If we want to do math or comparisons
      with the speed, we can convert it to an int using the
      <c>Integer.parseInt</c> method that will be described in the next lesson.
    </p>

    <program>
      // Split the line of data into an array of Strings
      String[] data = line.split(",");
      // Identify the data
      // data: Number,Name,Type1,Type2,HP,Attack,Defense,Speed,PNG,Description
      String name = data[1];
      String type1 = data[2];
      ...
      String speed = data[7];
      String imageFile = data[8];
    </program>

    <p>
      Try the exercise below to display Pokemon images using the <c>split</c>
      method to extract names and urls saved in the file.
    </p>

      In the last lesson, we read in a file of Pokemon data. In this exercise,
      we will read in the file and calculate the average Pokemon speed and find
      the Pokemon with the highest speed. The speed is the 8th column in the
      file; when a row of data is split into an array with the index starting at
      0, the speed will have the 7th index. We will use the

    <title>Object-Oriented Design with CSV Files</title>

    <p>
      To better organize and work with this data, we can create a <c>Pokemon</c>
      class that corresponds to these attributes using object-oriented design. A
      CSV data file can be saved into an array of <c>Pokemon</c> objects by
      splitting each line (except the header) into the attributes for one
      <c>Pokemon</c> object.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use the <c>split</c> method to extract the individual pieces of
      data from each line of the CSV file and save this data into a
      <c>Pokemon</c> object. We must first create a <c>Pokemon</c> class with
      instance variables that correspond to the data attributes, and a
      constructor that initializes these variables. Assuming that we have
      already written the <c>Pokemon</c> class and constructor, the following
      code creates a Pokemon object from the data using its constructor and
      saves it into an array of <c>Pokemon</c> objects.
    </p>

    <program>
      // Create an array of Pokemon objects
      Pokemon[] pokemonArray = new Pokemon[152];

      int i = 0;
      while (scan.hasNext())
      {
          String line = scan.nextLine();
          // Split each line into its attributes name, type1, etc.
          String[] data = line.split(",");
          String name = data[1];
          String type1 = data[2];
          ...
          String speed = data[7];
          String imageFile = data[8];

          // Create a Pokemon object from the split data
          Pokemon p = new Pokemon(name, type1, speed, imageFile);
          // Save p in the array
          pokemonArray[i] = p;

          i++;
      }
    </program>

    <p>
      Note that sometimes you may need to skip the 0th row in the file if it is
      column headers. For this file, it will just get split into strings, but if
      your data file contains numbers that need to be processed, you could skip
      one like: <c>if (i == 0) scan.nextLine();</c>.
    </p>

      Let’s try the code to read into an array of Pokemon objects in the

      Let’s end with a challenge that combines all the skills you have learned
      so far. You could work in pairs for this challenge. Create a class
      <c>Pokemon</c> that has at least three attributes that can be found in the
      Pokemon file, including its <c>name</c>, <c>type1</c>, and
      <c>imagefile</c>, and any other attributes from the file that you would
      like. Write a constructor and getters for these attributes. Then, read in
      the data from the pokemon file, split each line, and save the data in an
      array of <c>Pokemon</c> objects. Write a <c>findType</c> method that
      returns to the type of a <c>Pokemon</c> given its name as an argument. It
      should loop through the array to find the right <c>Pokemon</c> object
      using the <c>getName</c> and <c>getType</c> methods that you will write.
      It should also display the image for the Pokemon.

    <title>Optional Challenge with a Dataset</title>

    <p>
      If your class has time, you can try the following open-ended challenge
      that uses a dataset of your choice. You could work in pairs for this
      challenge. Choose a dataset from the files <url
      href="external/_static/datasets/pokemon.csv">pokemon.csv</url>, <url
      href="external/_static/datasets/WorldIndicators2000.csv">WorldIndicators2000.csv</url>,
      or <url
      href="external/_static/datasets/StateData2020-CDC-Census.csv">StateData2020-CDC-Census.csv</url>
      to read into an array of objects. The activecode window below is set up to
      use these files. Look at the columns of the dataset you have chosen at the
      bottom of this web page to decide on the name and at least 3 attributes
      for your class. Each row in the data file will be an object of your class
      that you will add to the array. If you find another data CSV file online
      that you would like to use, you can read from a URL instead of a file in
      Java using the <c>java.net</c> package following the directions here <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/urls/readingURL.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/urls/readingURL.html</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you have chosen an input file, use the Pokemon exercise in the
      section above as a guide to:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Design a class for the input file that you have chosen. Choose at
            least 3 attributes that can be found in the file for your class.
            Write a constructor that takes in these attributes as parameters and
            saves them into instance variables. You may need to add some getters
            and a <c>toString</c> method as well.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Declare an array of your class type.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Read in the data from the file.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Inside a loop, split each line into its attributes and create an
            object for your class using its constructor. Add the object to the
            array.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            Do something interesting with the data using a loop, for example you
            could find the maximum or minimum value of an attribute or print out
            all the objects that have the same attribute value.
          </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.1) A <term>file</term> is storage for data that persists
            when the program is not running. The data in a file can be retrieved
            during program execution.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.2) A file can be connected to the program using the
            <c>File</c> and <c>Scanner</c> classes.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.3) A file can be opened by creating a <c>File</c> object,
            using the name of the file as the argument of the constructor.
            <c>File(String str)</c> is the <c>File</c> constructor that accepts
            a <c>String</c> file name to open for reading, where <c>str</c> is
            the pathname for the file.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.4) When using the <c>File</c> class, it is required to
            indicate what to do if the file with the provided name cannot be
            opened. One way to accomplish this is to add <c>throws
            IOException</c> to the header of the method that uses the file. If
            the file name is invalid, the program will terminate.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.5) The <c>File</c> and <c>IOException</c> classes are part
            of the <c>java.io</c> package. An <c>import</c> statement must be
            used to make these classes available for use in the program.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.6) The following <c>Scanner</c> methods and
            constructor—including what they do and when they are used—are part
            of the <url
            href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference.pdf">Java
            Quick Reference</url> (p. 2) provided during the AP CSA exam:

                  <c>Scanner(File f)</c> the Scanner constructor that accepts a
                  File for reading.

                  <c>int nextInt()</c> returns the next int read from the file
                  or input source. If the next <c>int</c> does not exist, it
                  will result in an <c>InputMismatchException</c>. Note that
                  this method does not read the end of the line, so the next
                  call to <c>nextLine()</c> will return the rest of the line

                <p>
                  <c>double nextDouble()</c> returns the next double read from

                  <c>boolean nextBoolean()</c> returns the next Boolean read
                  from the file or input source. If the next <c>boolean</c> does
                  not exist, it will result in an <c>InputMismatchException</c>.

                <p>
                  <c>String nextLine()</c> returns the next line of text up
                  until the end of the line as a <c>String</c> read from the
                  file or input source; returns the empty string if called
                  immediately after another <c>Scanner</c> method like
                  <c>nextInt</c> that is reading from the file or input
                  source;returns null if there is no next line.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <c>String next()</c> returns the next String up until a white
                  space read from the file or input source.

                <p>
                  <c>boolean hasNext()</c> returns true if there is a next item
                  to read in the file or input source; false otherwise.

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.7) Using <c>nextLine</c> and the other <c>Scanner</c>
            methods together on the same input source sometimes requires code to
            adjust for the methods’ different ways of handling whitespace.

          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.8) The following additional <c>String</c> method—including
            what it does and when it is used—is part of the <url
            href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference.pdf">Java
            Quick Reference</url> provided during the AP CSA Exam:

                <p>
                  <c>String[] split(String del)</c> returns a <c>String</c>
                  array where each element is a substring of <c>this String</c>,
                  which has been split around matches of the given expression
                  <c>del</c>.

                  For example, <c>String[] data = line.split(",");</c> splits a
                  line from a csv file along the commas and saves the substrings
                  into the array <c>data</c>.

          <p>
            (AP 4.6.A.9) A <c>while</c> loop can be used to detect if the file
            still contains elements to read by using the <c>hasNext</c> method
            as the condition of the loop.

            (AP 4.6.A.10) A file should be closed when the program is finished
            using it. The <c>close</c> method from <c>Scanner</c> is called to
            close the file.
