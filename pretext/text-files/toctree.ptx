  <introduction>
    <p>
      While we can initialize arrays and <c>ArrayList</c>s in our programs
      that’s only reasonable to do for small amounts of data. It’s not very
      convenient if we want to write a program that processes a lot of data. And
      processing large amounts of data is one of the things computers are great
      at. Also, if we initialize our data structures in our program, then we
      need to edit our program and recompile it if we want to process different
      data, which is not convenient at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of embedding data directly in the source code of our programs, we
      typically store data as files on the computer’s hard drive and then load
      data from those files in our programs. This allows us to write a program
      once that can run the same computation on different data just by loading a
      different file.

    <p>
      In this chapter we’ll look at how to load data from files and put it into
      an <c>ArrayList</c> so we can then compute answers based on the data using
      list algorithms like the ones we discussed in the previous chapter.
