  <title>Data from files</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      When a Java program runs, the data it operates on has to be in the
      computer’s memory. When we create a variable we are allocating a small bit
      of memory which we can then initialize to hold one value. When we create
      an array on an <c>ArrayList</c>, we are allocating a larger chunk of
      memory that can hold lots of values. But where do those values that we put
      into memory come from?
    </p>

    <p>
      They might come from our code. If we make an array like:
    </p>

    <program>
      String[] foods = new String[] { "egg", "chicken", "fruit cup" };
    </program>

    <p>
      we are creating an array that holds those three <c>String</c> values.
    </p>

    <p>
      But initializing data in our code this way is only reasonable when we’re
      dealing with small amounts of data. It would be really cumbersome to
      include a million element array of words in our source code. Also it would
      mean that if we wanted to run the program on different data, we would need
      to change our program. So we need another way to load data if we want to
      processes a lot of data or process different data at different times.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of embedding data directly in the source code of our programs, we
      typically store data in <term>files</term> on the computer’s hard drive
      and then load the data from those files into our programs. This allows us
      to write a program once that can run the same computation on different
      data just by loading a different file. (Programs can also write data to
      files but we are not going to cover that in this course.)

    </p>

    <p>
      All of the different ways that data can be stored in files is a bigger
      topic than we can cover. Instead in this chapter we are going to focus on
      files that contain <term>data sets</term>, collections of data made up of
      many instances of the same basic kind of data such as a list words in a
      dictionary, of students in a class, or books in a library.
