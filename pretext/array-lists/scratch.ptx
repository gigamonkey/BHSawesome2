    <p>
      You can use <c>ArrayList</c> instead of arrays whenever you don’t know the
      size of the array you need or you know that you will add and remove items
      and may need to change the array’s size dynamically during run time. An
      <c>ArrayList</c> is <term>mutable</term> in size and contains object
      references, meaning it can change during run time by adding and removing
      objects from it.

    <idx><h>list</h><h>autoboxing</h></idx>
    <idx><h>list</h><h>unboxing</h></idx>
    <p>
      Primitive types like <c>int</c> and <c>double</c> are automatically
      converted to their corresponding wrapper classes <c>Integer</c> and
      <c>Double</c> using autoboxing when added to an <c>ArrayList</c>. When you
      pull an <c>int</c> value out of a list of <c>Integers</c> that is called
      <term>unboxing</term>.
    </p>

    <program>
      <![CDATA[
      ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
      list.add(new Integer(5)); // this will work in Java 7
      list.add(5); // this will work in all Java versions
      ]]>
    </program>

    <p>
      You can put any kind of objects into an <c>ArrayList</c>. Even instances
      of a class that you wrote. For example, here is an <c>ArrayList</c> of
      <c>Student</c>s.
    </p>


    <p>Here is a comparison of how to create arrays and <c>ArrayList</c>s:</p>

    <program>
      <![CDATA[
      // arrays must specify a size!
      int[] highScores = new int[5];
      String[] names = new String[5];

      // ArrayLists are empty to start with
      ArrayList<Integer> highScoreList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
      ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
      ]]>
    </program>
