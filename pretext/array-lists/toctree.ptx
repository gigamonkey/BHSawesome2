  <title>ArrayLists</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="arrays" /> we learned about arrays, as our first data type
      that we can use to hold multiple values. However arrays are not very
      flexible. Most notably, the size of an array is established at the time of
      creation and cannot be changed. What are we supposed to do if we want to
      collect an unknown number of objects. Or if we want to both add and remove
      items from a collection? For example, if we wanted to represent a shopping
      list, we might add to the list throughout the week and remove things from
      the list while we are shopping. We wouldn’t want to have to guess when we
      first made our shopping list at the beginning of the week how many things
      we were going to put in it.

    <p>
      For cases like this, Java has a class called <c>ArrayList</c> which is a
      resizable list. It is called <c>ArrayList</c> because it stores the items
      that have been added to it in an underlying array. But it also takes care
      of keeping track of how many items have been added to the array and it
      will create a new bigger array under the covers when needed to hold more
      items. If you’ve used other languages like Javascript, Python, or Snap! an
      <c>ArrayList</c> is much more like the lists and arrays in those languages
      than Java’s arrays are.

      In this chapter we’ll look at how to make and use <c>ArrayList</c>s and
      also look at something called <term>wrapper classes</term> that exist to
      bridge the gap between Java’s primitive types and arrays and classes like
      <c>ArrayList</c>. Then we’ll review how to apply loop contstructs and loop
      based algorithms that we’ve used with arrays and <c>String</c>s to
      <c>ArrayList</c>s plus a few new algorithms that only apply to
      <c>ArrayList</c>s since they are resizable.
