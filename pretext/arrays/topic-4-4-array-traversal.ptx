  <title>Looping over arrays</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Loops and arrays go together like peas and carrots. It’s like they were
      made for each other. Actually, they kind of were. In this lesson, we will
      learn how to combine loops with arrays, from simple cases like using a
      loop do something with each element of an array in order, to more complex
      cases like processing just part of an array or processing the elements
      backwards.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Using a canonical <c>for</c> loop</title>

    <p>
      In the last lesson, we mentioned that we can use a variable or any other
      <c>int</c> expression for the index in an array access expression. We can
      even do math inside the <c>[]</c>, like below.
    </p>

    <program>
      // highScores array declaration
      int[] highScores = { 10, 9, 8, 8};
      // use a variable for the index
      int index = 3;
      // modify array value at index
      highScores[index] = 11;
      // print array value at index
      System.out.println(highScores[index]);
      System.out.println(highScores[index - 1]);
    </program>

    <p>
      What does the code above print out? You can follow the code in this <url

    <p>
      One of the most common situations where we will use a variable for the
      index into an array is when the variable is the loop variable in a
      canonical <c>for</c> loop where the loop limit is the length of the array.
      Indeed, it’s traditional to name the loop variable in a <c>for</c> loop
      <c>i</c> as an abbreviation for “index”.

    <p>
      Here’s a canonical <c>for</c> loop that loops over (or
      <term>traverses</term>) the <c>highScores</c> array. Try the code below in
      the <url
      href="http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=public%20class%20ArrayLoop%0A%7B%0A%20%20%20%20public%20static%20void%20main%28String%5B%5D%20args%29%20%0A%20%20%20%20%7B%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20int%5B%5D%20highScores%20%3D%20%7B%2010,%209,%208,%208%7D%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20for%20%28int%20i%20%3D%200%3B%20i%20%3C%20highScores.length%3B%20i%2B%2B%29%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20System.out.println%28%20%20highScores%5Bi%5D%20%29%3B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%20%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%7D&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=0&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=java&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false">visualizer</url>
      to see how it executes step by step.
    </p>

    <program>
      <![CDATA[

      int[] highScores = { 10, 9, 8, 11};

      // Loop over array with a canonical for loop
      for (int i = 0; i < highScores.length; i++) {
          System.out.println(highScores[i]);
      }

      ]]>
    </program>

    <p>
      However, with a bit of practice we won’t need to step through loops like
      this to understand them. We should be able to see at a glance that this
      loop is doing something with each element of the array in order. Once we
      see what that something is—printing the value—we can describe what the
      loop does at a higher level than tracing through it step by step. We could
      describe what the loop above does as, “prints every element of
      <c>highScores</c>”.

          Then, run it to see if you were right.

      Using a canonical <c>for</c> loop pretty much ensures that we won’t create
      any of the common looping bugs. Our loop variable will take on exactly the
      legal indices into our array, starting at <c>0</c> and going up to one
      less than the length so we won’t crash our program with an
      <c>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</c>.

    <title>Enhanced <c>for</c> loop</title>

    <p>
      There is a special kind of loop that can be used with arrays (and some
      other data structures) called the <term>enhanced <c>for</c> loop</term> or
      a <term>for each loop</term>. This loop is designed for the common case
      where we just want to do something with each element of an array and don’t
      actually care about the index.
    </p>

    <p>
      The basic structure looks like the loop on the left which is equivalent to
      the normal <c>for</c> loop on the right, both looping over a <c>String</c>
      array, <c>names</c>. The only difference is that in the enhanced
      <c>for</c> loop the code doesn’t have to worry about the index variable
      <c>i</c>.
    </p>

    <sidebyside>
      <listing>
        <title>Enhanced <c>for</c> loop</title>

        <program>
          for (String s : names) {

            // use s
          }
        </program>
      </listing>

      <listing>
        <title>Regular <c>for</c> loop</title>

        <program>
          <![CDATA[

          for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
            String s = names[i];
            // use s
          }

          ]]>
        </program>
      </listing>
    </sidebyside>

    <p>
      In an enhanced <c>for</c> loop the loop variable before the <c>:</c> holds
      the value of each element of the array in turn without us having to use a
      separate index variable to get at it. This means the type of the variable
      has to be the same as the element type of the array. We can read this loop
      as “for each <c>s</c> in <c>names</c>” which is why this kind of loop is
      called a for-each loop.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the examples below in Java that loop through an int and a String
      array. Notice the type of the loop variable is the type of the array.
    </p>

    <program>
      int[] highScores = { 10, 9, 8, 8 };
      String[] names = { "Jamal", "Emily", "Destiny", "Mateo" };

      // for each score in highScores print it
      for (int score : highScores) {
          System.out.println(score); // Notice no index or [], just the variable score!
      }

      // for each name in names print it
      for (String name : names) {
          System.out.println(name);
      }
    </program>

    <p>
      We should use the enhanced <c>for</c> loop whenever we can, because it’s
      more concise and cuts down on errors. However it isn’t always applicable.
      The main limitation is that we don’t have access to the underlying index
      variable. So we can’t, for instance, easily compare adjacent elements of
      an array or modify the value at whatever position we are in, in the array.
      For instance, there’s no way to use an enhanced <c>for</c> loop to write
      something like this regular <c>for</c> loop which adds one to each element
      of an array of <c>int</c>:
    </p>

    <program>
      <![CDATA[

      for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        numbers[i]++; // Need the index to be able to change the array element
      }

      ]]>
    </program>

    <p>
      Similarly, since we have no control over the order we access the elements
      of the array we can’t use the enhanced <c>for</c> loop if we want to loop
      backwards through an array or over only part of an array. And to use the
      enhanced loop we need something to loop over. That can be an array or a
      few other data types, such as <c>ArrayList</c> which we’ll learn about in
      <xref ref="array-lists" />. But we need <em>something</em> to loop over
      whereas with a regular <c>for</c> loop we can loop using whatever
      initializer, condition, and updater we want.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because a regular <c>for</c> loop is more flexible than the enhanced
      <c>for</c> loop, we can always rewrite an enhanced loop using a regular
      loop but not always the other way around.

              Correct! For-each loops access all elements and enable users to

              For-each loops, as well as allowing users to refer to array

    <title>More complex loops</title>

    <p>
      So we should us the enhanced <c>for</c> loop when we can which covers a
      lot of cases where we would use a canonical regular <c>for</c> loop. But
      there are cases where we will need the flexibility of a regular loop such
      as if we want to loop over a specific range in the array or to process the
      array in reverse order.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, the following code doubles the first five elements in an
      array. Notice that it uses <c>Math.min</c> to compute the limit because we
      want the loop to run five times or the whole length of the array if it has
      fewer than five elements. Another way to write this would be with a more
      complex boolean expression such as <c>i &lt; values.length &amp;&amp; i
      &lt; 5</c>. Which is clearer is a matter of taste but using
      <c>Math.min</c> is arguably more to the point.

    <title>Looping From Back to Front</title>

    <idx><h>loop</h><h>from back to front</h></idx>
    <p>
      You don’t have to loop through an array from the front to the back. You
      can loop by starting at the back of the array and move toward the front
      during each time through the loop. In the example below, the method
      <c>getIndexOfLastElementSmallerThanTarget</c> returns the index of the
      last element in the array that is smaller than the given argument. The
      <term>return</term> statement inside the loop stops the execution of the
      loop and the method and returns the index that is found immediately back
      to the main method. It returns -1 if there is no number in the array that
      is smaller than the given number.
    </p>

          What does the following code print out? Notice that the array and the
          target are passed in as arguments to the
          getIndexOfLastElementSmallerThanTarget method. Trace through it
          keeping track of the array values and the output. Then run it to see

              The method returns the index of the first item in the array that
              is less than the value, not the value.

              Since the method loops from the back towards the front -15 is the
              last value in the array that is less than -13 and it is at index
              1.

              No, the method correctly starts the index at values.length - 1 and
              continues as long as i is greater than or equal to 0.

              You can not start the index at the length of the array. You must
              start at the length of the array minus one. This is a common
              mistake.

      <title>Spellchecker</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
          This challenge includes a dictionary file of 10,000 English words
          which is read into the array <c>dictionary</c> for you. You could use
          this <url
          href="https://replit.com/@BerylHoffman/SpellChecker1">replit</url>
          code instead that has an even bigger dictionary of English words and
          lets you do input with your spell checker. We will learn how to read
          in files using Java later on in <xref ref="text-files" />.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Write a <c>print10</c> method that prints out the first 10 words
                of the dictionary array. Do not print out the whole array of
                10,000 words!
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Write a <c>spellcheck</c> method that takes a word as a
                parameter and returns true if it is in the dictionary array. It
                should return false if it is not found (When can you tell that
                you have not found a word in the dictionary?). Test your code
                below by changing the word sent to the spellcheck() method in
                main. This algorithm is called a <term>linear search</term>
                where we step through the array one element at a time (here the
                dictionary one word at a time) looking for a certain element.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Optional Challenge: Write a method
                <c>printStartsWith(String)</c> that prints out the words that
                start with a <c>String</c> of letters in the <c>dictionary</c>
                array. Your method should take a parameter for the
                <c>firstLetters</c> as a <c>String</c>. You could use the Java
                String <url
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_string_startswith.asp">startsWith()</url>
                method here if you’d like to, or use <c>indexOf</c> to see if
                the <c>firstLetters</c> is at index 0 of the string. This is not
                autograded.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.4.A.1) <term>Traversing an array</term> is when repetition
            statements are used to access all or an ordered sequence of elements
            in an array.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.4.A.2) Traversing an array with an indexed <c>for</c> loop or
            <c>while</c> loop requires elements to be accessed using their
            indices.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            In <c>for</c> and <c>while</c> loops, make sure the index for an
            array starts at 0 and end at the number of elements − 1. <term>Off
            by one</term> errors are easy to make when traversing an array,
            resulting in an <term>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</term> being
            thrown.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            An <term>enhanced for loop</term>, also called a <term>for each
            loop</term>, can be used to loop through an array without using an
            index variable.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            To set up a for-each loop, use <term>for (type variable :
            arrayname)</term> where the type is the type for elements in the
            array, and read it as “for each variable value in arrayname”.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.4.A.3) An enhanced <c>for</c> loop header includes a variable,
            referred to as the enhanced <c>for</c> loop variable. For each
            iteration of the enhanced <c>for</c> loop, the enhanced <c>for</c>
            loop variable is assigned a copy of an element without using its
            index.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.4.A.4) Assigning a new value to the enhanced <c>for</c> loop
            variable does not change the value stored in the array. (So, you
            can’t change an array using the enhanced for loop.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.4.A.5) When an array stores object references, the attributes
            can be modified by calling methods on the enhanced <c>for</c> loop
            variable. This does not change the object references stored in the
            array. (So, you can change the attributes of an object in an array
            using the enhanced for loop.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            (AP 4.4.A.6) Code written using an enhanced <c>for</c> loop to
            traverse elements in an array can be rewritten using an indexed
            <c>for</c> loop or a <c>while</c> loop.
          </p>
