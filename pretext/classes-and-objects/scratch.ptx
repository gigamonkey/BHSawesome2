  <p>
    Remember that a <term>class</term> in Java defines a blueprint for creating
    objects. When you create <term>objects</term>, you create new
    <term>instances</term> of that class and what you can do with those
    instances is determined by what methods are defined in the class.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can create instances of the <c>Person</c> class with <c>new</c> as in
    <c>new Person()</c> And you can declare variables that can hold a reference
    to a <c>Person</c> object with <c>Person variableName</c>. Or put it
    altogether to declare some variables and initialize each one with a
    reference to a new <c>Person</c> as shown here.
  </p>

  <program>
    Person ada = new Person();
    Person charles = new Person();
  </program>

  <p>
    The real meat of a class is in the <term>methods</term> which define the
    behaviors of the objects of that class. Remember that most methods either do
    things (like the <c>Turtle</c> methods that moved the turtle on the screen)
    or return values like the <c>getXPos</c> and <c>getYPos</c> on
    <c>Turtle</c>. The methods of the class share access to the object’s
    instance variables and when a method is called on an object it uses the
    instance variables for that object. For example in the <c>Turtle</c> class
    the <c>forward</c> method changes an instance variable <c>xPos</c>. When you
    call <c>forward</c> on <c>yertle</c> it changes <c>xPos</c> on the
    <c>yertle</c> object and when you call it on <c>myrtle</c> it changes the
    <c>xPos</c> on the <c>myrtle</c> object.
  </p>

  <p>
    Putting it all together, the three main anatomical features of a class are
    the <term>instance variables</term> which hold values associated with each
    object, the <term>constructors</term> whose job is to initialize the
    instance variables, and the <term>methods</term> who contain the code that
    gives the objects their behavior and which can use the instance variables
    defined in the class.
  </p>

  <program>
    public class Person {
        // instance variables

        // constructors

        // methods

    }
  </program>

  <p>
    And finally one last bit of weird anatomy, kind of like the human appendix
    which is only sometimes needed: any Java class can have a <c>main</c> method
    which can be used to run that class as a program either to test that one
    class or sometimes as the entry point to a whole program made up of many
    classes and objects.

    <title>Designing a Class</title>

    <p>
      Now that we know what the skeleton of a class looks like and the elements
      that make up the body of the class, we’re ready to create our own class.
      Let’s start with a quick look at how to design a class such as
      <c>Person</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      One important question we have to ask when designing a class is, what data
      does it represent? In this case we can ask, what would we want to know
      about a person? Our answer will depend on what problem we are trying to
      solve. In one program, perhaps an address book, we might want to know the
      person’s name and phone number and email. In another program, such as a
      medical application, we might need to know their vital signs such as their
      blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      For now let’s go with the address book example. Here’s a fleshed out
      <c>Person</c> class with instance variables, a constructor, and methods.
      We’ll go through the details in the next few sections but for now you can
      run the code to see how it constructs 2 <c>Person</c> objects and fills in
      their data. Remember that execution always starts in the <c>main</c>
      method. When a method like <c>print</c> is called, the code defined in the
      method runs but when it gets the values of <c>name</c>, <c>email</c>, and
      <c>phoneNumber</c> it gets the specific values of those variables that
      were set by the constructor when the particular object we called
      <c>print</c> on was created. Click on the Show CodeLens button below and
      the Next button to run the code step by step.

  <subsection xml:id="data-encapsulation">
    <title>Data encapsulation</title>

    <p>
      <term>Data encapsulation</term> is an object-oriented design technique in
      which the implementation details of a class are kept hidden from external
      classes. The keywords <c>public</c> and <c>private</c> are called
      <term>access modifiers</term>, and they affect how you can the access
      classes, data, constructors, and methods. The keyword <c>public</c> means
      anyone can access this; it allows access from classes outside the
      declaring class. The keyword <c>private</c> restricts access to the
      declaring class which means that variables or methods marked private are
      only accessible inside the class where they are defined. In general,
      instance variables in a class should be declared <c>private</c> to ensure
      data encapsulation.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <figure align="center">
    <caption>Person Class and Objects</caption>

    <image source="Unit3-Class-Creation/Figures/PersonClassWithCookies.png" width="100%" alt="Person data encapsulation" />
  </figure>

  <p>
    Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class in order to
    accomplish encapsulation. It is good programming practice to designate the
    instance variables as <c>private</c> in order to ensure <term>data
    encapsulation</term> where the data (instance variables) and the code acting
    on the data (methods) are wrapped together into a single unit and the
    implementation details are hidden. Only code in the class can access or
    change the values of <c>private</c> instance variables. This keeps the data
    secure and makes it a lot easier to keep track of how your program works
    than if you had to worry that any code anywhere in a much larger program
    could possibly change the values of the variables.
  </p>

  <p>
    Code in other classes can only interact with the <c>public</c> methods you
    provide and cannot directly access the <c>private</c> instance variables
    (shown in the pink box above). When designing a class you get to decide what
    data to make accessible or modifiable from other classes by what
    <c>public</c> methods you provide.

    <title>Class Hierarchy and Inheritance</title>

    <idx>inheritance</idx>

    <idx>Object</idx>
    <p>
      Another important concept in object-oriented programming is
      <term>inheritance</term>. Although the AP CSA exam no longer covers
      inheritance, you should know what it means. <term>Inheritance</term> is a
      way to create a new class that is based on an existing class. The new
      class, called a <term>subclass</term>, inherits the attributes and
      behaviors of the existing class, called a <term>superclass</term>. In
      Java, all classes are subclasses of a superclass called
      <term>Object</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, you could have a superclass called <c>Pet</c> with attributes
      like <c>name</c> and <c>age</c> and behaviors like <c>eat</c> and
      <c>sleep</c>. You could then have subclasses like <c>Dog</c> and
      <c>Cat</c> and <c>Turtle</c> that inherit the attributes and behaviors of
      the <c>Pet</c> class. Each subclass could add attributes and behaviors
      specific to that type of pet. For example, a <c>Dog</c> subclass could
      have an attribute called <c>breed</c> and a behavior called <c>bark</c>.
    </p>

  <p>
    You can also think of a class as defining a new data type. In this lesson,
    we will use the class <c>Turtle</c> to make animated turtle objects. Just
    like you use <c>int</c> to declare variables that hold numbers, you can use
    <c>Turtle</c> to declare many variables, animated turtle objects, who are
    <term>instances</term> of the <c>Turtle</c> class.

        Discuss with your class: What are some attributes of cats? What are some

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Within an instance method or a constructor, the keyword <c>this</c> acts
      as a special variable that holds a reference to the current object—the
      object whose method or constructor is being called.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, in the following Class Person, when we create an object p1
      and call the constructor or p1.setEmail(), the word “this” refers to p1.
      And when we make the same method calls with object p2, “this” refers to
      p2. Run the code below and also check it out in the Java visualizer with
      the Show CodeLens button which shows how this refers to different objects
      when the code is run.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <c>this</c> variable can only be used in instance methods and
      constructors. Class methods cannot refer to <c>this</c> or instance
      variables because they are called with the classname, not an object, so
      there is no <c>this</c> object.

      variables. Programmers can give the parameter variables the same names as
      the instance variables and this can distinguish them and avoid a naming
      conflict. For example, both the instance variable and the parameter
      variable are called name in the code below, but <c>name</c> on its own
      looks for the closest local variable, the parameter variable, whereas
      <c>this.name</c> refers to this object's instance variable.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        <c>this.instanceVariable</c> can be used to distinguish between this
        object’s instance variables and local parameter variables that may have
        the same variable names.
      </p>

    <program>
      // instance variables
      private String name;

      // constructor
      public Person(String name)
      {
         // Set this object's instance variable name to the parameter variable name
         this.name = name;
      }
    </program>
