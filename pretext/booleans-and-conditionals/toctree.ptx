  <title>Booleans and conditionals</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Now that we know how to structure our code using methods, we need to learn
      some more basics about how to write the code that goes <em>in</em> our
      methods. In this unit and the next we will look at Java's <term>control
      constructs</term>, the parts of the lanuage that allow us to control what
      happens when. With just a few basic control constructs we will be able to
      write code to implement any <term>algorithm</term> that it is possible to
      run on a computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter we will introduce the notion of algorithms and then talk
      about <term>if statements</term> which allow us to write programs that do
      things only if certain conditions are true.
