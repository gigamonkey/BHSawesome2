  <title>Values and variables</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Computers operate on <term>data</term> which is stored as
      <term>bits</term>, usually described as “zeros and ones”, in the
      computer's memory. Though even that’s a bit of a fairy tale: in the
      computer each bit is actually represented by the state of a tiny
      electrical circuit.
    </p>

    <p>
      However sequences of zeros and ones—let alone microscopic circuitry—aren't
      convenient for humans to deal with, so programming languages like Java
      give us higher-level abstractions for dealing with data that let us treat
      those sequences of bits as <term>values</term> that have some meaning to
      us humans. The kinds of values, called <term>data types</term>, supported
      by a programming language and what we can do with them are the most basic
      building blocks of our programs
    </p>

    <p>
      In a program the bits of code that produce values are called
      <term>expressions</term>. Every expression <term>evaluates to</term> a
      value. In this section we’ll deal with two of the most basic kinds of
      expressions. First, <term>literal values</term> are the way we write
      specific values in our program, that will be turned into the appropriate
      bits in memory when the program runs. These are things like <c>123</c> and
      <c>3.14</c>. Second, we can create names in our program, called
      <term>variables</term> that represent a place in the computer’s memory
      where a value can be stored which we can then refer to by the variable’s
      name. In a later unit we’ll talk about expressions that use
      <term>operators</term> that cause the computer to perform computations
      using existing values to produce new values.

    <p>
      In Java, every value has a <term>data type</term> that determines how it
      is represented in the computer’s memory (which mostly we don’t have to
      worry about) and what we can do with it. There are two categories of data
      types in Java. One, <term>primitive types</term>, hold the kinds of values
      that the computer can directly operate on such as numbers which we can do
      math with and logical values that we can do, well, logic with. The other,
      <term>reference types</term> hold a reference to a more complex value
      called an object. For now we’ll focus on three of the main primitive data
      types in Java. We’ll come back to reference types in <xref ref="classes"
      />.
    </p>

    <p>The primitive types you need to know about for the AP exam are:</p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <c>int</c> which can represent integers, i.e. numbers with no
            fractional part such as 3, 0, -76, and 20393.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>double</c> which can represent non-integer numbers like 6.3 -0.9,
            and 60293.93032. Computer people call these “floating point” numbers
            because the decimal point “floats” relative to the magnitude of the
            number, similar to the way it does in scientific notation like
            <m>6.5 ✕ 10^8</m>. The name <c>double</c> comes from the fact that
            <c>double</c> values are represented using sixty-four bits, double
            the thirty-two bits used for the type <c>float</c> which used to be
            the normal size floating point number when most computers did math
            in units of 32-bits. (<c>float</c> is rarely used these days and is
            not part of the AP curriculum.)
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <c>boolean</c> which can represent only two values: <c>true</c> and
            <c>false</c>. We’ll discuss the <c>boolean</c> type in <xref
            ref="booleans-and-conditionals" />
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to think of a data type is as a set of values and a set of
      operations on those values. For example, the <c>int</c> datatype
      represents the set of integers that can be represented in thirty-two bits
      (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647) and they support the normal arithmetic
      operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as
      well as a few that you probably didn’t learn about in elementary school.

              While you could use an int, this would throw away any digits after
              the decimal point, so it isn't the best choice. You might want to

              An average is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by

              While you could use an int and use 0 for false and 1 for true this
              would waste 31 of the 32 bits an int uses. Java has a special type

    <title>What is a variable?</title>

    <idx>variable</idx>
    <p>
      There are two aspects to a <term>variable</term>. To the computer a
      variable is a location in its memory that can store a value. The value
      stored at that location can change, or vary, while the program is running
      which is why we call them variables. To us human programmers, on the other
      hand, the important aspect of a variable as its name that we can use to
      refer to the data without having to know about the variable’s exact
      location in memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, in a computer game we might need to keep track of the
      player’s score, which will start at 0 and increase as the player earns
      points. The score can be stored somewhere in memory but in our program
      we’ll refer to it with the name <c>score</c> since that’s much more
      convenient than something like “address <c>66a3ffec</c>”.
    </p>

    <title>Declaring variables in Java</title>

    <idx>declare</idx>
    <idx><h>variable</h><h>declare</h></idx>
    <p>
      To create a variable, you must tell Java its data type and its name.
      Creating a variable is also called <term>declaring a variable</term>. The
      type is a keyword like <c>int</c>, <c>double</c>, or <c>boolean</c>, but
      you get to make up the name for the variable. When you create a variable
      that will hold a primitive type, Java will set aside enough memory to hold
      a value of that type and will associate that memory location with the name
      you used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computers store all values using <term>bits</term> (binary digits). A
      <term>bit</term> can represent two values and we usually say that the
      value of a bit is either 0 or 1. When you declare a variable, you have to
      tell Java the type of the variable because Java needs to know how many
      bits to use and how to represent the value. The 3 different primitive
      types all require different number of bits. An integer gets 32 bits of
      memory, a double gets 64 bits of memory and a boolean could be represented
      by just one bit.
    </p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>
        Examples of variables with names and values. Notice that the different
        types get a different amount of memory space.
      </caption>

      <image source="Unit1-Using-Objects-and-Methods/Figures/typesAndSpace.png" width="89%" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      To <term>declare</term> (create) a variable, you specify the type, leave
      at least one space, then the name for the variable and end the line with a
      semicolon (<c>;</c>). Java uses the keyword <term>int</term> for integer,
      <term>double</term> for a floating point number (a double precision
      number), and <term>boolean</term> for a Boolean value (true or false).
    </p>

    <p>Here is an example declaration of a variable called score.</p>

    <program>
      int score;
    </program>

    <p>
      After declaring a variable, you can give it a value like below using an
      equals sign <c>=</c> followed by the value.
    </p>

    <program>
      int score;
      score = 4;
    </program>

    <p>
      Or you can set an initial value for the variable in the variable
      declaration. Here is an example that shows declaring a variable and
      initializing it all in a single statement.
    </p>

    <program>
      int score = 4;
    </program>

    <p>
      The equal sign here <c>=</c> doesn’t mean the same thing as it does in a
      mathematical equation where it is an assertion that the two sides
      <em>are</em> equal. In programming it means <em>make</em> them equal by
      setting the variable named on the left to the value of the expression on
      the right. The line above sets the value of the variable <c>score</c> to
      the literal value <c>4</c>. The variable always has to be on the left side
      of the <c>=</c> and the value expression on the right.

    <title>Naming Variables</title>

    <idx><h>variable</h><h>names</h></idx>
    <p>
      While you can name your variable almost anything, there are some rules. A
      variable name should start with an alphabetic character (like a, b, c,
      etc.) and can include letters, numbers, and underscores <c>_</c>. It must
      be all one word with no spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can’t use any of the keywords or reserved words as variable names in
      Java (<c>for</c>, <c>if</c>, <c>class</c>, <c>static</c>, <c>int</c>,
      <c>double</c>, etc). For a complete list of keywords and reserved words,
      see <url
      href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.9">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se22/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.9</url>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The name of the variable should describe the data it holds. A name like
      <c>score</c> helps make your code easier to read. A name like <c>x</c> is
      not a good name for a variable holding a score, because it gives no clues
      what the variable is used for. On the other hand, don’t use names that are
      too long like <c>theNumberThatHoldsTheScore</c> as those are also hard to
      read. Choose names that make your code easier to understand, not harder.
    </p>

    <note>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Use meaningful variable names!</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Start variable names with a lower case letter and use camelCase.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Variable names are case-sensitive and spelling sensitive! Each use
              of the variable in the code must match the variable name in the
              declaration exactly.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Never put variables inside quotes (<c>""</c>).</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </note>

    <idx>camel case</idx>
    <idx><h>variable</h><h>naming convention</h></idx>
    <p>
      The convention in Java and many programming languages is to always start a
      variable name with a lower case letter and then uppercase the first letter
      of each additional word, for example <c>gameScore</c>. Variable names can
      not include spaces so uppercasing the first letter of each additional word
      makes it easier to read the name. Uppercasing the first letter of each
      additional word is called <term>camel case</term> because it looks like
      the humps of a camel. Another option is to use underscore <c>_</c> to
      separate words, but you cannot have spaces in a variable name.
    </p>

    <activity label="varCaseSensitive">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Java is case sensitive so <c>gameScore</c> and <c>gamescore</c> are
