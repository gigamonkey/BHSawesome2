  <title>Anatomy of a class</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="topic-1-7-APIs-and-libraries" /> we saw how classes define
      new data types whose values share a set of <term>attributes</term> and
      <term>behaviors</term>. We also saw how different objects, while having
      the same abstract attributes, each have their own values for those
      attributes and how an object’s values can then affect their behavior in
      some way. For instance all <c>Turtle</c> objects have a position but two
      <c>Turtle</c> objects can be at different positions on the screen. And
      both can be made to move forward from wherever they are with the
      <c>forward()</c> method.
    </p>

    <p>
      To review the vocabulary, a <term>class</term> defines the
      <term>attributes</term> and <term>behaviors</term> that all objects of
      that class will have. From a class we make many <term>objects</term> also
      called <term>instances</term> of the class. Each instance has its own
      values for the attributes defined in the class. <term>Attributes</term>
      are the data or properties that an object knows about itself, for example,
      a turtle object’s color and size. <term>Behaviors</term> are the things
      that an object can do. For example, a turtle object can go forward, turn
      left, or turn right. The attributes and behaviors of a class are defined
      in the class, but each object has its own values for the attributes.

    <p>
      The following picture has lots of cats (objects of the type cat). They are
      all different, but they share the same attributes and behaviors that make
      up a cat. They are all <term>instances</term> of cat with different values
      for their attributes. Name some of the attributes and behaviors of the
      cats below. For example, the color ( <em>attribute</em>) of the first cat
      is black ( <em>attribute value</em>) and it is playing (
      <em>behavior</em>).

    <p>
      But thinking in terms of abstract attributes and behaviors is the outside
      view of a class, for when we’re using an API. Now it’s time to open up the
      black box and see how classes are structured on the inside. In this
      section we’ll take a very quick tour through the main parts of a class.
      Then we’ll go through each part in more detail in the following sections.

    <title>Quick tour: instance variables, constructors, and methods</title>

    <p>
      When we open up the black box, we find classes have three main parts:
      instance variables, constructors, and methods. In order to have something
      to talk about, let’s look at a simple but complete class, <c>Person</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of this class is to model a person as someone who has two
      attributes, a name and an age. A person also has two behaviors: they can
      print out a greeting where they introduce themselves and they can answer
      the <c>boolean</c> question of whether they can vote, which depends on
      whether they are eighteen or older.
    </p>

    <p>For instance we should be able to write this code:</p>

    <program>
      Person person1 = new Person("Joe", 18);
      Person person2 = new person("Sally", 17);
      person.greet(person2);
      System.out.println("Joe can vote: " + person1.canVote());
      System.out.println("Sally can vote: " + person2.canVote());
    </program>

    <p>and when we run it get this output:</p>

    <pre>
      Hello Sally, I'm Joe.
      Joe can vote: true
      Sally can vote: false
    </pre>

    <p>
      Here’s the code for a <c>Person</c> class that meets those requirements.
    </p>

    <program>
      <![CDATA[
      public class Person {

        // Instance variables
        private String name;
        private int age;

        // Constructor
        public Person(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }

        // Methods
        public void greet(Person other) {
          System.out.println("Hello " + other.name + ", I'm " + name + ".");
        }

        public boolean canVote() {
          return age >= 18;
        }
      }
      ]]>
    </program>

    <p>Let’s take this in chunks, starting with the first line:</p>

    <program>
      public class Person {
    </program>

    <p>
      Almost all the classes we write will start with the keyword <c>public</c>.
      It just means the class can be used in other classes. We will occasionally
      have to write classes without the <c>public</c> in exercises in this book
      but only because of limitations of the platform this book runs on.
      However, the really important word in this line is <c>class</c> which says
      we’re defining a class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next is the name of the class, <c>Person</c>. Class names in Java are
      always capitalized. It is not strictly required by the language but is as
      universally followed a convention as just about anything in programming.
      Consequenly, Java code with uncapitalized class names can be extremely
      confusing, especially to experienced Java programmers, so don’t write code
      with uncapitalized class names!
    </p>

    <p>
      After the name of the class comes the opening <c>{</c> of the <term>class
      body</term> which, like the body of a method, is defined inside a pair of
      <c>{}</c>s. Everything that makes up the definition of the class must be
      inside that pair of <c>{}</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first thing in the body of this class are two variable declarations:
    </p>

    <program>
      private String name;
      private int age;
    </program>

    <p>
      The only new thing here, compared to other variable declarations we’ve
      seen, is the keyword <c>private</c>. After that, they look like regular
      variable declarations with a type and a name. But because these variables
      are defined at the top level of the class, meaning not inside a method,
      they are called <term>instance variables</term> and they are what define
      the attributes instances of this class have. So from these two lines we
      can see that every <c>Person</c> object has two attributes, a name and an
      age. Each instance of the class has its own set of instance variables that
      aren’t shared with other instances so we can have two different
      <c>Person</c> objects, each with their own <c>name</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next thing we define in a class are usually its
      <term>constructors</term>. We’ll talk a lot more about constructors in a
      future section but the short version is, a constructor’s job is to
      initialize an object’s instance variables. Our <c>Person</c> class has one
      constructor:
    </p>

    <program>
      public Person(String name, int age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
      }
    </program>

    <p>
      We’ll get into the details soon but for now, just know that this code runs
      we write something like <c>new Person("Joe", 18)</c> and the arguments
      <c>"Joe"</c> and <c>18</c> become the values of the parameters <c>name</c>
      and <c>age</c>. Those values are then assigned to <c>this.name</c> and
      <c>this.age</c> which are specifically the instance variables we defined
      above. This constructor guarantees that whenever we make a <c>Person</c>
      we have to supply a name and an age and those values are stored in the
      object’s intstance variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally the behaviors of this class, emitting a greeting, and answering
      the question of whether a specific <c>Person</c> can vote, are provided by
      the two methods:
    </p>

    <program>
      <![CDATA[
      public void greet(Person other) {
        System.out.println("Hello " + other.name + ", I'm " + name + ".");
      }

      public boolean canVote() {
        return age >= 18;
      }
      ]]>
    </program>

    <p>
      You should be familiar with how methods work from <xref
      ref="topic-1-9-method-signatures" /> but there are two new things here.
      First, both of these methods refer to a variable that is neither a
      parameter nor is declared inside the method. The method <c>greet</c> has
      one parameter, <c>to</c>, but the code in the method also refers to the
      variable <c>name</c>. And <c>canVote</c> has no parameters but its code
      refers to the variable <c>age</c>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This works because of the second new thing that about these methods,
      compared to the ones we’ve written before now: theey do not have the
      keyword <c>static</c> in their signature. That makes them <term>instance
      methods</term> which means they have access to the instance variables
      defined in the class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Watch this short video to review some of the key vocabulary of
      object-oriented programming and then we’ll move on to a more detailed
      examination of these three parts of a class.
