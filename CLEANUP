- Remove the Day1/Day2 divisions that were put in to keep numbers lined up with
  the College Board.

- Each sub-chapter file should have only one top-level header. Any other
  sections should be subsections if needed. I.e. clicking on each a top-level
  TOC element in the Unit TOC should take you to a new URL. That is not the
  case, for instance, in the inheritance unit.
